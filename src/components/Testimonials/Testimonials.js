                    "I was at a low point in my life and was looking for help. My medical doctors could not identify why I was having neurological discomfort. I was spiritually lost and emotionally in turmoil. A friend told me about Darby and while I never heard of craniosacral therapy, I was certainly open to anything.  I couldn’t have felt more comfortable with Darby from the start. She is approachable and amiable and seems to instinctually know what would help me each session. With each session, I felt more and more restored physically and emotionally. I became more aware of my physical and emotional needs and discovered ways, with Darby’s help, how to tend to them. I look forward to my sessions with Darby. They are like lunching with a friend with whom you can talk about anything, and leave feeling uplifted and encouraged. Darby is part therapist, part healer and part friend."

                    "When first moving to San Diego in 2019, I started seeing Darby for bodywork sessions to help with issues related to an old IUT band injury affecting my legs and hips. She was fantastic in helping me, however regrettably, I did not see her on a regular basis (new job, etc.) Now, having been fully vaccinated, I am fortunate to be able to wisely prioritize weekly session with her. In addition to the recurring leg issues, I have been seeing Darby to help with stomach stress (physical + mental). My sessions with her are blissfully therapeutic as she can seemingly take control of my nervous system — which I don’t believe I could trust to anyone else — and sooth my ailments, even un-identified ones. The reduction in stress alone is invaluable to my overall well-being. On top of being a lovely person, I cannot more emphatically recommend Darby to help with that which ails you."

                    "Darby has been a catalyst for positive change in physical, emotional, and spiritual change. She has worked with me through massage, reiki, and as a trusted advisor. I really appreciate Darby’s authenticity, candor, and loving kindness. Highly recommend!"

                    “Darby has a gift of listening both to you and your body. She’s done quite a bit of work on my feet, which were in a very bad state after spending too much time in heals. I’ve gained an incredible amount of flexibility and relief after only our first session. It felt like a miracle!”

                    "My experience with Darby was amazing. First, I love the location of her office and the room is such a great space. Second, Darby combines and weaves together multiple healing gifts for an incredible body experience. Her use of reiki is awesome and use of vocal toning allowed me to participate in helping release tight muscles. She is intuitive and knows the body really well, and her knowledge of yoga influenced stretches she gave me that could be done at home. Everything about the experience felt above and beyond. From massages I can sometimes leave with a headache or in pain and I left with a sense of freedom in my body and increased energy. When seeking bodywork, Darby is a must!"

I’ve used her since I’ve had my baby as well. My husband goes to her too. He says she’s the best. So strong and thorough. I highly recommend Darby!”

Well worth the money as I left feeling better than I had in a long time. Thank you, Darby!”

                    “Exceptional massage, very calm opening environment, effective communication in just the right amount.  Pre and post consult on injury/problem areas.  I had a great connection with Darby - she was able to pull me out of my head and into my body.  She consistently felt when I was drifting and re-centered me.  Song bowls to start the session cleared and generated my immediate focus.  I could and would have stayed all day, and I’m very glad I spent 2 hours with her.  Left feeling very loose and relaxed, free from worry and stress.  Also feel focused on priorities, distractions have far less merit.”

                    “A truly magical, inspirational and spiritual experience awaits anyone who treats themselves to a healing and invigorating visit to Body by Darby. I was not a fan of massage before my visit as I had tried it before but broken and sore with zero flexibility and chronic back and chest pain from an injury and a lifetime of lower back issues I decided to try it once more. I am converted my friends, healed by the truly talented hands of a gifted, caring and delightful healer.

                    The magic started with Darby's sweet caring demeanor as she listened with earnest as I told her of my lifestyle, my pain, and the activities I had been deprived of due to pain. She carefully described the session and the methods she would be employing and she gently encouraged me to let my body heal by letting go mentally and spiritually of the stress I was holding inside.

                    After I got settled she entered the room and gently began to explore trouble areas as she narrated the session in a soothing voice. Then the mastery of her craft began to unfold as I felt years of misused muscle tissue respond and the pain began to release. The more she worked the deeper I began to feel the release until such a point as I felt my mind and spirit soar. I was used to flinching and wincing through a session and feeling only mildly better afterward. This time was different as I felt younger, lighter and most importantly happier with every passing moment. At one point through her guided moves, deep breathing and her reassurance I was released into a truly spiritual experience like none I had ever had.

                    The amazing part of this is over the next few days the resurgence of youthfulness continued. The next morning I woke for the first time in 17 years without back pain. I hadn't played golf in two months and the next day I was on the golf course and broke 220 yards for the first time. I was working in the garden again. I was sleeping better. I was walking further and faster much to the delight of my dog. I danced with my wife. I am a 50 year old man who feels more like 30.

                    Body by Darby will be a way of life for me now. Darby has given me freedom, she has given me life, she has given me youth and I will be grateful to her for this gift every day for this gift.

                    Do not hesitate. Don't waste another moment of life if pain or tension is holding you back. Call Body by Darby now and remove the bondage of pain through the skillful master of healing that she is. Thanks Darby!I have been around the world, but this is the best massage I have ever received.  Darby is professional, caring, and amazing at her craft.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to relax their body, mind, and soul.  This is not your typical massage as you will leave feeling refreshed physically and spiritually.

Well worth the money as I left feeling better than I had in a long time.  Her location is right by a beautiful view of the ocean and there is plenty of parking.  Do yourself a favor and book an appointment asap.  Thank you!!!”
